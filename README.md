# NamelessOS
My old hacking tool.
## Info
This tool has some skidded code in since i was learning greyscript and idk where it is from since i made it a while ago

NOTE: some stuff will be broken and it is not a compile and execute script but i did make it a bit easier to understand since you will need to edit some stuff.

# How to use:

1. copy the contents of the namelessos_singleplayer.gs file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nameless9000/NamelessOS/main/namelessos_singleplayer.gs)
2. buy a server
3. enter the details into the singleplayer map eg. 'singleplayer = {"db":"1.1.1.1","pass":"password"}'
4. compile
