# NamelessOS
My hacking tool.

# How to use:

1. compile nlib1.gs as /root/nlib1 (MAKE SURE TO CLICK ALLOW IMPORT)
2. buy a server
3. enter the details into the server map (namelessos.gs) eg. 'server = {"db":"69.69.69.69","pass":"anonymoose"}'
4. enter your email details into the email map (namelessos.gs) eg. 'email = {"user":"gamer@cornhub.com","pass":"epik"}'
5. (optional) put your public ip into ipProtect to hide your details in emails and hide your ip on shell ui
6. compile namelessos.gs
7. (optional) delete /root/nlib1
